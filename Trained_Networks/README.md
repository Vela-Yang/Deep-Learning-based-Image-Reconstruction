# Trained Networks  

## The filename indicates the size of given image size while training the network, like '256.pth' means the image size is 256x256 in training set.  

## You can load the parameters to model by *'model.load_state_dict(torch.load('1.pth'))'*.   

## As far as I tested, '256.pth' provides the excellent performance.
